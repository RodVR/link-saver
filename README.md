I created the Link Saver extension following Scrimba's "Build a Chrome Extension" guide and added a "Copy" option to copy the URL and a "Delete" option to delete individual URLs, instead of only having a "Delete All" function.

The "Copy" option was inspired by my experience after finishing my coding bootcamp. I've been sending out numerous job applications, and I noticed that some websites don't auto-fill the LinkedIn and GitHub input fields. With this extension, I don't need to have two tabs open, one with my LinkedIn and another with my GitHub, and sometimes I get distracted and somehow close the tabs, making me have to open them again just to simply copy the URL. Now with this extension, I can simply click to copy the desired URL and paste it.

Although this might seem like a small "issue," I found it both fun and challenging to develop.
